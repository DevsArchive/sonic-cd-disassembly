# Misc. Sonic CD File Disassemblies
This is a collection of documented disassemblies of various misc. files from Sonic CD.

## Currently Contains
* Initial program
* System program

* System program extension file (SPX)
* Backup RAM initialization file (BRAMINIT)

## Caution
Sonic CD's core CD engine is, quite frankly, a disaster. It's overengineered and reeks of spaghetti code. If you are thinking of making a Sega CD game, then you would be better off starting from scratch than to take notes from Sonic CD.
